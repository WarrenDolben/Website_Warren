			<h2>An Everyman's Computer Upgrade</h2>
			<h3>Written for Fiat Lux May 2011</h3>
			
			<p> This is it.  This is my last article.  It seemed to make sense to give my loyal readership 
			something to work on over the summer.  In the last issue I discussed cleaning your computer to 
			speed it up.  Being able to clean the "house" is a useful skill.  However, sometimes cleaning 
			isn't enough.  Newer programs typically weigh your computer down more than older ones.  As 
			time goes on, even the most well-kept machine can seem like it's slowing down.</p> 
			<p>What if I told you that there is a specific piece of hardware inside your computer that, 
			in my experience, slows down the average computer user more than every other component 
			combined?</p>
			<p>What if I then told you, that this important piece of hardware is also the cheapest and 
			easiest to upgrade?</p>
			<p>This mystery piece of computer hardware is called RAM, or random access memory.  It comes 
			in "sticks" of a few different sizes, but is not quite the same as a thumb drive.  How so?  
			Well to describe the difference I will have to explain my basic idea of your computer.  
			Prepare to have your mind blown.</p>
			<p>My favorite analogy for a computer is that it's a chef in a fancy restaurant.  You, 
			the customer, ask for something delicious like... listening to the Tron Soundtrack.  Before 
			anything can happen, the chef (let's call him Brian) will need ingredients.  Brian goes to 
			the shelves and grabs his ingredients.  In this case, the ingredients would include the song 
			file itself, the files needed to use iTunes, and probably some audio decoders and such.  
			The shelves are your computer's hard drive, which some people refer to as memory, but you 
			should call it storage to make everything easier.  </p>
			<p>People sometimes get memory sticks confused with flash drives.  Thumb/flash drives are 
			storage and plug into your computer from the outside.  Think of them like a portable storage 
			cart.</p>
			<p>With ingredients in hand, Brian goes back to his table to work.  This table is your RAM.  
			It's where the magic happens.  Brian prepares your food.  In less than a second (hopefully), 
			your song begins to play.  (To complete the analogy, your CPU, or central processing unit, can 
			be compared to how fast Brian works and thinks.  Dual Core is like having 4 hands.)</p>
			<p>As long as the song is playing or paused, it stays on Brian's table.  This makes it so that 
			whenever YOU want to enjoy it, Brian won't have to go through all the work of finding ingredients 
			and putting them together again.  On your computer, we can call this "in memory."  For the most
			part, programs and files on your computer are in storage (the ingredient shelves) until you need 
			them when they are moved to your RAM (Chef Brian's table).  Nifty right?  This basic storage/memory 
			relationship exists on any modern computer, as well as your phone, mp3 player, Wii, tablet computer,
			etc.</p>
			<p>If you are using a program, it's safe to say that it is being temporarily stored in your RAM.  
			This is true of anything from your computer clock and the little icons on your desktop, to Diablo 
			III and that huge raw video you are editing.</p>
			<p>The trouble is that sometimes your "table" isn't big enough to hold all of the stuff you do at 
			once.  When this happens, Brian (your computer) will start putting food back on the storage shelves 
			to free up space on the table.  Brian prioritizes, and tries to put unimportant stuff away.  Then, 
			when you need the food that was put away, Brian has to go back to the shelves and find it again.  
			On a computer, this is a "major page fault."  Hard drives access data much slower than RAM, so 
			having to walk over to the "shelves" and pick out stuff again slows you down significantly.</p>
			<p>How do you know if this happening to you?  Well... usually your computer tells you.  If your 
			computer is complaining about "virtual memory", "out of memory", or "expanding page file", 
			chances are good that insufficient RAM is behind it.  Also, if your computer always gets noticeably
			slower when you have tons of programs running, then you might consider an upgrade.  </p>
			<p>Computer companies don't want you to upgrade, they want you to buy a new machine!  Luckily for us, 
			upgrading RAM, assuming that you purchased the right sticks, takes 2 minutes tops.  First we have to 
			find the right memory though... I recommend you download a program called Speccy (or use System Profiler 
			in Mac).  Both programs provide a neat report of the "stuff" you have inside your machine.</p>
			<p>Launch Speccy and wait for it to load.   Then click the "RAM" button.  We are only really interested 
			in the top section, "Memory slots."  Check to see if you have free memory slots.</p>
			<p>If you have free slots: Scroll down to the blue header titled "SPD" and click the blue arrow to 
			expand.  Adding memory to what you already have is cheaper, but you have to make sure that the memory 
			you add is IDENTICAL to the memory you already have.  For example, another memory stick in my laptop 
			would have to be (type) DDR2 (size) 2048MB (manufacturer) Samsung and (Max Bandwidth) PC2-5300.  Leave 
			Speccy open and browse to your favorite computer component buying site (I personally love newegg.com).  
			It won't be hard for you to find memory to your specifications.</p>
			<p>If you do not have free slots: The "free slots gang" has a cheaper solution than us, but our job 
			is easier.  Go to your favorite computer component buying site (I use newegg.com) and buy memory that 
			is larger than what you have as well as being the same type (usually DDR2, possibly DDR3).  You are 
			replacing the memory in your full slots, so you won't have to match sticks.</p>
			<p>While doing the actual installation is a breeze, subtle differences between computers makes writing 
			detailed instructions difficult for me.  I recommend googling the model of your computer followed by 
			"memory upgrade" to find instructions specific to you.  Assuming you have a laptop, find the appropriate 
			compartment and open it (only 1 screw for me) to gain access to your memory.  Once you're there all you 
			have to do is slide the stick in until the lock clicks... yeah.  The stick will only fit in one way.</p>
			<p>Final thoughts: When working inside computers, always turn off and unplug everything.  Your computer 
			could shock you.  Comically, you can also shock your computer and fry internal components!  Avoid wearing 
			synthetic clothes or working on rugs.  Touch a metal surface before you begin to discharge static.  Make
			sure your hands are clean.  </p>
			<p>Intimidated yet?  I have never met anyone in Alfred that I didn't think could pull this off in 10 minutes 
			(excluding shipping).  If you are considering buying a new machine or are sick of only running one program 
			at a time, this could be the best $30 you ever spent.</p>
			<p>You just modded your computer.  Welcome to the club.  Hack the planet.</p>
