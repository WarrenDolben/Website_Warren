I have been having way too much fun messing with/thinking about this site. For a few hours I entertained the idea of hosting my resume, but I eventually decided that I would not want curious viewers to see a generic resume. My next place of attack will be an interesting (but not too garish) global background. Where do web developers find all the high resolution images I see on blogs? Sometimes I wish this was Wordpress and there was a handy drop down list of backgrounds to use...

			<p>Woah.  The site looks different today!  I have been digging into my CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

			From my understanding, website design used to revolve around single page designs.  Each individual page (HTML file) would be given all of the necessary styling to do colors, shapes, and layout.  These days,

There was too much clicky. I upgraded the "blog" to its own special button in order to get rid of the links that were threatening to take over the homepage. Next, I plan to merge the "contact" button into the site template. That way you can see my email address everywhere you go.

In bigger news, I posted my site up on Facebook today for everyone to see. (If you came here from Facebook today, WELCOME!) This required finally setting up some of my meta-properties so that the preview in Facebook listed the site title, a description, and had a nice little square that I made in Inkscape.

Next Monday, I start work in Technical Sales for Senior-Systems. I will of course continue to actively update this site and continue working on Javascript. Since I have a week of freedom, things might get interesting around here...

First of all, the hurricane was awesome for me. I have been without power for 17 hours, which has given me time to catch up on reading. It helps too that I have been at work all day, otherwise I would have been trying to rig up some kind of crazy tin foil antennae so I could pick up someone's wifi signal... or something. All of my problems are first world problems.

Work is pretty exciting so far. Since the database that I am supposed to manage is not yet complete, I have had some time to learn some more about jQuery, js, and HTML. Hopefully I will be able to put it all to good use at work.

I like how I always use my previous blog-post as a template for my new blog posts. This ensures that I see what I intended to do last month and feel bad about not doing it yet. I will be changing the layout of the site drastically (and slowly), with the goal of making it appear more professional.

My contact info should hover next to my name. Also, I may switch the scheme to something, maybe grey.

            Everyone remembers the day they turned on their computer for the first time. Everything looked so new and so... sleek. These days, new hotness has become old and busted. You live with it though, because the change was gradual. You adapt, even when you have to wait 30 minutes between pressing "ON" and getting the mouse to respond. If this describes a friend, tear this column out and give it to them for Easter. If it describes you, feel free to read on...

Many people falsely believe that computers get slow with age. I'm here to help you bust this myth. With the right cleaning, there is no reason to think that your computer would be any slower than the day you opened it.

Don't worry; I'm not going to bore you about my adventures in overclocking (running hardware beyond the rated speed). The next few tips are EASY and can be carried out in any order and require maybe 5 minutes of effort each. Not only are they easy, these tips actually work.

Quick and Easy Tips:

Run all updates! So easy. So important.

Restart your computer, log in, and let all of your "start-up programs" do their thing. Then one by one go through each launched program (messengers are big offenders here) and decide whether or not you NEED it to launch automatically. Find the settings of each unwanted program and uncheck "Start with Windows". Now restart again to see if any come back.

Go to "Control Panel" and then "Add or Remove Programs". Find any program that you no longer want/need and remove it. Be careful to only remove things that you know are unneeded (for example if it says Microsoft leave it alone).

Hit "Start", then "Accessories", then "System Tools". Find "Disk Cleanup" and run it. This will clean up temporary files that tend to build up on your system. Then find "Disk Defragmenter" and run that. It reorganizes data on your computer to read faster. For added control, do a Google search for "CCleaner" and "Defraggler". They are free programs that do the same thing listed above, but arguably better.

Security... because you don't want bugs in your house:

Run all updates! So easy. So important.

Check your antivirus. Is it working? Is it expired? Is it even on? If in doubt, google and download "Microsoft Security Essentials" (Vista or 7). Not only is the software easy to use (and free), it's actually pretty good. You should only have one antivirus program running at a time. Alternatives could include Avira, Avast, Panda, or AVG.

Firewall. Is it working? Is it on? Windows (beyond Vista) firewall software is decent, as long as it's running.

An Easter Gift?

The hard drive in your computer becomes much less efficient when it is filled past 90%. A great way to remedy a full drive is to empty out the stuff you don't need. However, if you are still lacking in space there are USB (external) hard drives that you can buy online or at Wal-Mart. These external drives start around $30. They are also great for backing up all of your important data, which leads to the advanced tip.

Nuclear Warfare: Not For the Faint of Heart

If you still have your Windows disk (as well as any important program) laying around, it is possible to do a reformat (complete cleaning) of your hard drive. This erases everything and lets you start off with a "clean slate". In many cases, this will be faster than doing each tip as listed above. Unfortunately I do not have enough space to discuss it. Make sure to search the internet for advice on how to go about this.

Ghosts and Gremlins:

Sometimes the normal stuff just won't work. If your firewall/antivirus refuses to turn on, Windows can't seem to update, or something suspicious just seems to be happening (firewall always launches disabled, weird popups, ridiculous and unexplained slowness, blue screens, etc. Bring your computer to your friendly neighborhood ITS. You can find them at their headquarters in the bottom floor of Herrick.

            This is it. This is my last article. It seemed to make sense to give my loyal readership something to work on over the summer. In the last issue I discussed cleaning your computer to speed it up. Being able to clean the "house" is a useful skill. However, sometimes cleaning isn't enough. Newer programs typically weigh your computer down more than older ones. As time goes on, even the most well-kept machine can seem like it's slowing down.

What if I told you that there is a specific piece of hardware inside your computer that, in my experience, slows down the average computer user more than every other component combined?

What if I then told you, that this important piece of hardware is also the cheapest and easiest to upgrade?

This mystery piece of computer hardware is called RAM, or random access memory. It comes in "sticks" of a few different sizes, but is not quite the same as a thumb drive. How so? Well to describe the difference I will have to explain my basic idea of your computer. Prepare to have your mind blown.

My favorite analogy for a computer is that it's a chef in a fancy restaurant. You, the customer, ask for something delicious like... listening to the Tron Soundtrack. Before anything can happen, the chef (let's call him Brian) will need ingredients. Brian goes to the shelves and grabs his ingredients. In this case, the ingredients would include the song file itself, the files needed to use iTunes, and probably some audio decoders and such. The shelves are your computer's hard drive, which some people refer to as memory, but you should call it storage to make everything easier.

People sometimes get memory sticks confused with flash drives. Thumb/flash drives are storage and plug into your computer from the outside. Think of them like a portable storage cart.

With ingredients in hand, Brian goes back to his table to work. This table is your RAM. It's where the magic happens. Brian prepares your food. In less than a second (hopefully), your song begins to play. (To complete the analogy, your CPU, or central processing unit, can be compared to how fast Brian works and thinks. Dual Core is like having 4 hands.)

As long as the song is playing or paused, it stays on Brian's table. This makes it so that whenever YOU want to enjoy it, Brian won't have to go through all the work of finding ingredients and putting them together again. On your computer, we can call this "in memory." For the most part, programs and files on your computer are in storage (the ingredient shelves) until you need them when they are moved to your RAM (Chef Brian's table). Nifty right? This basic storage/memory relationship exists on any modern computer, as well as your phone, mp3 player, Wii, tablet computer, etc.

If you are using a program, it's safe to say that it is being temporarily stored in your RAM. This is true of anything from your computer clock and the little icons on your desktop, to Diablo III and that huge raw video you are editing.

The trouble is that sometimes your "table" isn't big enough to hold all of the stuff you do at once. When this happens, Brian (your computer) will start putting food back on the storage shelves to free up space on the table. Brian prioritizes, and tries to put unimportant stuff away. Then, when you need the food that was put away, Brian has to go back to the shelves and find it again. On a computer, this is a "major page fault." Hard drives access data much slower than RAM, so having to walk over to the "shelves" and pick out stuff again slows you down significantly.

How do you know if this happening to you? Well... usually your computer tells you. If your computer is complaining about "virtual memory", "out of memory", or "expanding page file", chances are good that insufficient RAM is behind it. Also, if your computer always gets noticeably slower when you have tons of programs running, then you might consider an upgrade.

Computer companies don't want you to upgrade, they want you to buy a new machine! Luckily for us, upgrading RAM, assuming that you purchased the right sticks, takes 2 minutes tops. First we have to find the right memory though... I recommend you download a program called Speccy (or use System Profiler in Mac). Both programs provide a neat report of the "stuff" you have inside your machine.

Launch Speccy and wait for it to load. Then click the "RAM" button. We are only really interested in the top section, "Memory slots." Check to see if you have free memory slots.

If you have free slots: Scroll down to the blue header titled "SPD" and click the blue arrow to expand. Adding memory to what you already have is cheaper, but you have to make sure that the memory you add is IDENTICAL to the memory you already have. For example, another memory stick in my laptop would have to be (type) DDR2 (size) 2048MB (manufacturer) Samsung and (Max Bandwidth) PC2-5300. Leave Speccy open and browse to your favorite computer component buying site (I personally love newegg.com). It won't be hard for you to find memory to your specifications.

If you do not have free slots: The "free slots gang" has a cheaper solution than us, but our job is easier. Go to your favorite computer component buying site (I use newegg.com) and buy memory that is larger than what you have as well as being the same type (usually DDR2, possibly DDR3). You are replacing the memory in your full slots, so you won't have to match sticks.

While doing the actual installation is a breeze, subtle differences between computers makes writing detailed instructions difficult for me. I recommend googling the model of your computer followed by "memory upgrade" to find instructions specific to you. Assuming you have a laptop, find the appropriate compartment and open it (only 1 screw for me) to gain access to your memory. Once you're there all you have to do is slide the stick in until the lock clicks... yeah. The stick will only fit in one way.

Final thoughts: When working inside computers, always turn off and unplug everything. Your computer could shock you. Comically, you can also shock your computer and fry internal components! Avoid wearing synthetic clothes or working on rugs. Touch a metal surface before you begin to discharge static. Make sure your hands are clean.

Intimidated yet? I have never met anyone in Alfred that I didn't think could pull this off in 10 minutes (excluding shipping). If you are considering buying a new machine or are sick of only running one program at a time, this could be the best $30 you ever spent.

You just modded your computer. Welcome to the club. Hack the planet.

            How I would Hack Your Facebook
            </h2>

            Written for Fiat Lux October 2011
            </h3>

            I want to talk about hacking Facebook. Before you ask, I have nothing against Zuckerberg. To be honest, I'm more interested in YOU. I want to hack your Facebook account for the purpose of stalking, revenge, mischief or outright fraud.

What kind of information is valuable? Credit card information is always a prime target for many thieves, but really anything from email addresses to music tastes could be of interest to someone with the wrong intentions

To combat security holes, the good guys create "Proof of concept" (PoC) tools and provide them to the public for downloading. Think of it as an attempted wake-up call to companies.

The issue with PoC tools being made available to download is that suddenly ANYONE can use the pre-made hacking tool to do what only experienced security programmers could do before. The personal information and number of users makes Facebook a tasty target.

One tool called "fbpwn" popped up early in September. It allows me, the hacker, to scan friends for personal information. It also grants the ability to clone my account from the account of someone else.

To hack you, I could clone my account as a friend who is already on your friends list. Then I would request you. You, having forgotten that this friend was already on your list or assuming they deleted you accidentally, press accept and give me access to your profile, phone number, pictures, friend lists, email, etc.

The program is set up to run dozens of "attacks" at once...

Luckily for us, this security hole is easy to fix. The first step is to make your friends list private. Doing this will prevent me from being able to copy your friends. Facebook has a handy new feature which allows you to view your profile from the eyes of a friend or the public. Look for the "View As" button next to "Edit Profile."

The next step is more of a lifestyle change. Never accept friend requests from people you don't know. Additionally, it is a good practice to check out the profiles of people who send you requests, as the clone accounts created by fbpwn tend to have empty profiles besides a name and picture.

Another scary little PoC tool is called Firesheep. Firesheep utilizes a special kind of HTTP session hijacking that many refer to as "sidejacking." Firesheep only works on Wi-Fi networks, however it does have 3g counterparts.

To hack your Facebook with Firesheep, we would have to be on the same wireless network (does "AUITS" sound familiar?). Most websites process logins (your username and password) using "cleartext", meaning that it is readable by anyone who happens to be "looking." Since information traveling to and from your laptop is flying freely through the air, I could easily snatch your login with my laptop it if I happened to be within range. Then I log in as you.

Very few (mostly banks) websites encrypt their traffic by default. Many offer the option though. I recommend downloading the add-on "HTTPS Everywhere" for Firefox or "Use HTTPS" for Chrome. This will force many sites to load in their safer mode.

If you hadn't already guessed, I have played with both tools as well as many others. I highly recommend that anyone who has the interest go check them out. However, I would never condone using these tools to do harm. If you know of friends who are vulnerable, TELL THEM. Friends don't hack friends.
