			<h2>700 Word Computer Care Cheat Sheet</h2>
			<h3>Written for Fiat Lux April 2011</h3>
			
			<p> Everyone remembers the day they turned on their computer for the first time.  Everything 
			looked so new and so... sleek.  These days, new hotness has become old and busted.  You live 
			with it though, because the change was gradual.  You adapt, even when you have to wait 30 
			minutes between pressing &quotON&quot and getting the mouse to respond.  If this describes a friend, 
			tear this column out and give it to them for Easter.  If it describes you, feel free to  read 
			on...</p> 
			<p>  Many people falsely believe that computers get slow with age.  I&#39;m here to help you bust this myth.  
			With the right cleaning, there is no reason to think that your computer would be any slower than the day 
			you opened it. </p>
			<p>Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;m not going to bore you about my adventures in overclocking 
			(running hardware beyond the rated speed).  The next few tips are EASY and can be carried 
			out in any order and require maybe 5 minutes of effort each.  Not only are they easy, these 
			tips actually work.</p>
			<p><b>Quick and Easy Tips:</b></p>
			<p>Run all updates!  So easy.  So important.  </p>
			<p>Restart your computer, log in, and let all of your &quotstart-up programs&quot do their thing.  
			Then one by one go through each launched program (messengers are big offenders here) and 
			decide whether or not you NEED it to launch automatically.  Find the settings of each unwanted
			program and uncheck &quotStart with Windows&quot.  Now restart again to see if any come back. </p>
			<p>Go to &quotControl Panel&quot and then &quotAdd or Remove Programs&quot.  Find any program that you no 
			longer want/need and remove it.  Be careful to only remove things that you know are unneeded 
			(for example if it says Microsoft leave it alone).</p>
			<p>Hit &quotStart&quot, then &quotAccessories&quot, then &quotSystem Tools&quot.  Find &quotDisk Cleanup&quot and run it.  
			This will clean up temporary files that tend to build up on your system.  Then find &quotDisk 
			Defragmenter&quot and run that.  It reorganizes data on your computer to read faster.  For added 
			control, do a Google search for &quotCCleaner&quot and &quotDefraggler&quot.  They are free programs that do 
			the same thing listed above, but arguably better.</p>
			<p><b>Security... because you don&#39;t want bugs in your house:</b></p>
			<p>Run all updates!  So easy.  So important.</p>
			<p>Check your antivirus.  Is it working?  Is it expired?  Is it even on?  If in doubt, 
			google and download &quotMicrosoft Security Essentials&quot (Vista or 7).  Not only is the software 
			easy to use (and free), it&#39;s actually pretty good.  You should only have one antivirus program
			running at a time.  Alternatives could include Avira, Avast, Panda, or AVG.</p>
			<p>Firewall.  Is it working?  Is it on?  Windows (beyond Vista) firewall software is decent, as 
			long as it&#39;s running.</p>
			<p><b>An Easter Gift?</b></p>
			<p>The hard drive in your computer becomes much less efficient when it is filled past 90%.  
			A great way to remedy a full drive is to empty out the stuff you don&#39;t need.  However, if 
			you are still lacking in space there are USB (external) hard drives that you can buy online 
			or at Wal-Mart.  These external drives start around $30.  They are also great for backing up 
			all of your important data, which leads to the advanced tip.</p>
			<p><b>Nuclear Warfare: Not For the Faint of Heart</b></p>
			<p>If you still have your Windows disk (as well as any important program) laying around, 
			it is possible to do a reformat (complete cleaning) of your hard drive.  This erases everything and 
			lets you start off with a &quotclean slate&quot.  In many cases, this will be faster than doing each tip as 
			listed above.  Unfortunately I do not have enough space to discuss it.  Make sure to search the internet
			for advice on how to go about this.</p>
			<p><b>Ghosts and Gremlins:</b></p>
			<p>Sometimes the normal stuff just won&#39;t work.  If your firewall/antivirus refuses to turn on, Windows 
			can&#39;t seem to update, or something suspicious just seems to be happening (firewall always launches 
			disabled, weird popups, ridiculous and unexplained slowness, blue screens, etc.  Bring your computer 
			to your friendly neighborhood ITS.  You can find them at their headquarters in the bottom floor of 
			Herrick.</p>
