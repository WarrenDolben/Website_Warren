			<h2>How I Would Hack Your Facebook</h2>
			<h3>Written for Fiat Lux October 2011</h3>
			
			<p> I want to talk about hacking Facebook.  Before you ask, I have nothing against Zuckerberg.  To be honest, I'm 
			more interested in YOU.  I want to hack your Facebook account for the purpose of stalking, revenge, mischief or 
			outright fraud.</p> 
			<p>What kind of information is valuable?  Credit card information is always a prime target for many thieves, but 
			really anything from email addresses to music tastes could be of interest to someone with the wrong intentions</p>
			<p>To combat security holes, the good guys create "Proof of concept" (PoC) tools and provide them to the public for 
			downloading. Think of it as an attempted wake-up call to companies. </p>
			<p>The issue with PoC tools being made available to download is that suddenly ANYONE can use the pre-made hacking 
			tool to do what only experienced security programmers could do before. The personal information and number of 
			users makes Facebook a tasty target.</p>
			<p>One tool called "fbpwn" popped up early in September.  It allows me, the hacker, to scan friends for personal 
			information.  It also grants the ability to clone my account from the account of someone else.</p>
			<p>To hack you, I could clone my account as a friend who is already on your friends list.  Then I would request 
			you.  You, having forgotten that this friend was already on your list or assuming they deleted you accidentally, 
			press accept and give me access to your profile, phone number, pictures, friend lists, email, etc.  </p>
			<p>The program is set up to run dozens of "attacks" at once...</p>
			<p>Luckily for us, this security hole is easy to fix.  The first step is to make your friends list private.  
			Doing this will prevent me from being able to copy your friends.  Facebook has a handy new feature which allows 
			you to view your profile from the eyes of a friend or the public.  Look for the "View As" button next to "Edit 
			Profile."</p>
			<p>The next step is more of a lifestyle change.  Never accept friend requests from people you don't know. 
			Additionally, it is a good practice to check out the profiles of people who send you requests, as the clone accounts 
			created by fbpwn tend to have empty profiles besides a name and picture.  </p>
			<p>Another scary little PoC tool is called Firesheep.  Firesheep utilizes a special kind of HTTP session hijacking 
			that many refer to as "sidejacking."  Firesheep only works on Wi-Fi networks, however it does have 3g counterparts. </p>
			<p>To hack your Facebook with Firesheep, we would have to be on the same wireless network (does "AUITS" sound 
			familiar?).  Most websites process logins (your username and password) using "cleartext", meaning that it is 
			readable by anyone who happens to be "looking."  Since information traveling to and from your laptop is flying 
			freely through the air, I could easily snatch your login with my laptop it if I happened to be within range.  
			Then I log in as you.</p>
			<p>Very few (mostly banks) websites encrypt their traffic by default.  Many offer the option though.  I recommend 
			downloading the add-on "HTTPS Everywhere" for Firefox or "Use HTTPS" for Chrome.  This will force many sites to 
			load in their safer mode.</p>
			<p>If you hadn't already guessed, I have played with both tools as well as many others.  I highly recommend that 
			anyone who has the interest go check them out.  However, I would never condone using these tools to do harm.  If 
			you know of friends who are vulnerable, TELL THEM.  Friends don't hack friends.</p>
